# ObstacleAvoidTank
Arduino self obstacle avoidance tank

Instead of starting right away, Arduino tank will wait for Bluetooth signal '1' from the paired device such as PC or Android.
Once received '1', the robot will navigate its own by avoiding obstacles. To stop the robot, send '0' to the Bluetooth module.
